# Telemetry

Telemetry in software, provides useful information for developers and maintainers that users are not always able to communicate. Telemetry tools are intended to collect, transform, and communicate data on performance, functionality, processing speed, errors, and security events of systems in production.

This project aims to evaluate and discover the features of telemetry frameworks and apply them to an existing prototype written in c++.

## Tasks

The tasks are as follows:

- Evaluate various telemetry frameworks and choose the best one.  
  compile a short report to motivate the choice  
  (kuserfeedback, OpenTelemetry, Baical, ...)
- Setup the chosen framework
- Study and implement the possibilities offered by the framework
- Apply telemetry to the prototype
- Analyze the telemetry results
- Each step for deployment and integration must be documented

## Requirements

Use of Qt 6.4.0
Our infrastructure has space on a shared server or on a hosted server.  
In any case, the development environment for the server side of the framework must be dockerized.  
Everything server side must be highly optimized.
